This repository is used to benchmark Spark performance on Azure Kubernetes Service. In this setup, we use Spark and Hadoop binaries downloaded from apache.org. 

You can also build your own image by downloading the Apache Spark distribution like those distributed by the Spark Downloads page and use ./dev/make-distribution.sh in the project root.
